Content Placeholder
This is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project that demonstrates how to create a loading placeholder effect — commonly known as a skeleton screen — to improve perceived performance while content is loading.

Features
Smooth animated placeholder (skeleton loader) effect
Automatically replaces placeholders with actual content after a delay
Minimal and clean design using Google Fonts

How It Works
On page load, a card with animated gray placeholders is displayed.
After 2.5 seconds, JavaScript replaces the placeholder elements with actual content (image, title, excerpt, author info).
The animation classes are removed to display the final styled content.

Technologies Used
HTML5 for structure
CSS3 (with keyframes) for animation and layout
Vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation and dynamic content injection
